        <p>
          We only collect data that is strictly necessary for operating our GPU rental platform. This includes basic contact and billing information submitted through direct inquiry. We do not track users, and no analytics or tracking tools store personally identifiable data.

          All data is stored exclusively on servers physically located in Switzerland. We do not use foreign cloud providers or transmit data abroad.

        <p>
          Our infrastructure is operated privately and independently, ensuring full control and accountability over data handling processes. Access to all data is restricted and managed according to the principles of privacy by design and by default, in line with Articles 7 and 8 of the nFADP.
